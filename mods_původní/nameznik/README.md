Nameznik
Adds some points from railway - fouling points, end points of train route, border points of railway companies - in Czech and Slovak design and fouling point in Austrian design. Technical names of nodes are in Czech language.

What are they?
* Nameznik / Fouling point marker - the point where when two tracks join together; past that point it's not safe to leave a wagon parked because trains on the other track will collide. Uses on side of track.
* Koncovnik / End point marker of train route - the point where train must stops if this point isn't defined by other signal. Uses on side of track.
* Nameznik s koncovnikem / Fouling point marker wuth end of train route - uses when both invariable signals before are at the same place. Uses on side of track.
* Hranicnik / End point marker of railway companies - point where on one direction of track is administrated by one company and opposite si administered by other company. Uses in track in the middle, between the rails, between two ties.

Námezník / Fouling point marker:
* variants 1, 2 and 5 are different variants of fouling point (with the same purpose), is used on Czech and Slovak railways.
* variant 3 is used in Austria, in real have different shape (in this mod, maybe in future)
* variant 4 is used in Czech and Slovak tramway tracks, not at all places (only in tram depots, loops on end of tramway tracks etc.), not in crosses of tramway tracks.

Repaintable and rotatable with my mod Repainter (but it isn't realistic, only for design or your own rules).
Actyally not contain crafting recipes.

Nodeboxes of translated points are primary on the registered place, not viewable place!

Best with AdvTrains and other advtrains-based mods.

KNOWED ISSUES:
* 1st) Mod creator has a procrastination for update and upgrade of
Noderoads and Nodehouses for a long time (but works on update).
* 2nd) Nodeboxes are not so much real as mod creator needs.
