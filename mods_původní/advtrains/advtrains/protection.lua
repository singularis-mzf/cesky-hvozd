	give_to_singleplayer= true,

-- Privileges to control TRACK BUILDING
minetest.register_privilege("track_builder", {
	description = attrans("Can place and dig tracks in unprotected areas"),

-- Privileges to control OPERATING TURNOUTS/SIGNALS

-- there is a configuration option "allow_build_only_owner". If this is active, a player having track_builder can only build rails and operate signals/turnouts in an area explicitly belonging to him
-- (checked using a dummy player called "*dummy*" (which is not an allowed player name))


-- Protection ranges

Protection/privilege concept:
Tracks:
	Protected 1 node all around a rail and 4 nodes upward (maybe make this dynamically determined by the rail...)
	if track_builder privilege:
		if not protected from* player:
			if allow_build_only_owner:
				if unprotected:
					deny
			else:
				allow
	deny
Wagons in general:
	Players can only place/destroy wagons if they have train_operator
Wagon driving controls:
	The former seat_access tables are unnecessary, instead there is a whitelist for the driving stands
	on player trying to access a driver stand:
	if is owner or is on whitelist:
		allow
	else:
		deny
Wagon coupling:
	Derived from the privileges for driving stands. The whitelist is shared (and also settable on non-driverstand wagons)
	for each of the two bordering wagons:
		if is owner or is on whitelist:
			allow

*"protected from" means the player is not allowed to do things, while "protected by" means that the player is (one of) the owner(s) of this area
