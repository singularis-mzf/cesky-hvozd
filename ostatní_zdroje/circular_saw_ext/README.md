# Extended Circular Saw. Mod For Minetest.

An extension for the circular saw from the original moreblocks mod (https://github.com/minetest-mods/moreblocks) with adding a big set of new microblocks shapes (columns, two/three-sided slabs, corners, slats and more). Also, for a convenience add a scrollable container for the circular saw output inventory list.
