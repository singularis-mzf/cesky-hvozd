for new minegeld images (this time I think I got them right). Because of

the default ones.

minetest_game git master); previous mese object image is now used only for mese 
block, so users of this texture pack will see the old black-on-yellow mese in

2012-08-20: Huge update in texture packs!  Everything that can be represented 
as a JPG image without a visible quality loss has been converted to that 
format.  That's basically everything that doesn't have an alpha channel.  A few 
images in the 512px set have been adjusted in size by virtue of my realizing 
they could be done better (e.g. Unknown block was too big, while throwing bow 
was too small).  All inventory items have been re-checked to make sure the 
under-512px sizes get the right images.

2012-08-13: New default sapling texture (does not affect that used for some 
mods).  Brought mesecons support up to date with the new nodebox-based stuff

made to the actual mod)

2012-08-01: Added geranium flower.

2012-07-07 (immediately after): Didn't like the tint I left on clay/clay lump.  
Reduced both to greyscale in keeping with the game's normal style.

2012-07-07: Recolored clay, gravel, and stone to look more like the colors used 
in the default textures, reworked coal, iron, and all moreores minerals to use 
transparency so they can composite properly on top of the stone.  Tweaked 
active furnace to look hotter, fixed wrong filenames, retired 'cooking' 
variant.

2012-06-30: Shifted torch on ceiling (both static and animated), so that base 
of torch is actually centered.  Created new default door imagery in the general

wooden door and all fence inventory images to max 64px also (most were 32px).

and a few of the lumps and blocks (shiner, more accurate colors, etc.).  
Lightened up and re-colored menubg image significantly.  Improved embossing on 
larger versions of mese.  Tinted iron apple slightly red-brownish (to suggest 
oxidation/rust).  Reworked grass side a bit to improve blending between grass 
and dirt.  Tweaked color and embossing on sandstone.  Fixed stray pixels and

Fixed stray pixels on larger sizes of flower pot (copy&paste error).  Tweaked

pick, added a few missing 16px maptools textures.  Tweaked default rails to 
better differentiate them from moreores copper rails.  Updated filename for 
current hatches mod (now just hatch.png).

2012-05-27: Added support for maptools, deleted furnace_furnace_* images (for a 
patch that will never happen), renamed some of them and created new ones to add 
support for darkrose's active furnaces patch (which *does* exist).  Split all 
texture packs into separate github repositories.

2012-05-16 (even later): deleted github repo and created a new one with 
multiple branches.

2012-05-16 (a bit later): added a few more colors to complete wool mod support.  
Updated github repo (didn't go through properly last time).

2012-05-16: Fixed a few stray pixels in the pies, scorched stuff and a few 
tools, cleaned up edges of cotton, cotton-in-pot, and cotton (ball), fixed 
slight slight lack of color saturation on chest top, added some shading to 
chest sides to make handles stand out better, reduced noise in dirt, grass+dirt 
side, and alien grass+dirt side, reworked mese, faded the color a bit on the 
paper, broke the repetitive look of the papyrus/bamboo, replaced tin and silver 
lumps with better images (actually derived from platinum and osmium), added 
support for wool mod.  Updated screenshots.

2012-05-06: Added support for my poison ivy mod.

2012-05-01: Created 32px and 128px versions.  Fixed a few stray pixels that 
snuck in while resizing some images earlier.  Reduced all fence and door images 
meant for the inventory display to max 32x32 (anything more is overkill).  
Reworked 16px door inventory image slightly.  Reworked other door images as 
well to fix scaling errors.  Reworked mesecons wall lever and wall button and 
wireless devices to improve overall appearance.  Reworked 512px "chicken" sign 
and all 256px and smaller signs to fix edge quality.  Reduced menubg to max 
128x128px.  Reduced treeprop to max 128x128 pixels (both are always displayed 
small, both lower in <128px packs).  Re-introduced 16 px pack - just gotta have 
it; it's a bit more complete than before, but still lacks Madblocks Infra, 
signs, and hydroponics mods.  Reworked unknown block/object/item images.

2012-04-29 (almost immediately): Fixed a few missing 64px and 256px images and 
image credits files.

2012-04-29: Reworked bushes/strawberry "tree" a bit, renamed a bunch of files 
and added a few more to bring Madblocks up to date (also adds good support for 
power lines/utilities).  Retired the 16px texture pack from distribution - it 
just isn't good enough.

2012-04-26 (a bit later): Removed Tron flowers from regular distribution 
(they're no longer used but I'll keep them locally just in case). Replaced 
previous-removed hydroponics images with better ones that won't make you itch. 
;-)

2012-04-26: Deleted all vine-like images related to the hydroponics mod.  I 
accidentally used a base plant that is most definitely NOT suitable for eating 
- poison ivy!  Will replace the missing images shortly.

2012-04-25 (a bit later): Reduced menu background image in 512px pack to 
256x256 (it's always displayed at 128x128 pixels, so this still provides some 
future-proofing).  Reduced half heart to 32x32 in 64/256/512px packs to match 
full heart.  Added support for particles mod (64px and up only, all images are 
49x49px in all cases).

2012-04-25: reworked moreblocks/rope to look more like the sort of swinging 
vines/ropes seen in movies and such (left the ones for the vines modpack 
alone).  Renamed a few files and added a bunch more to add support for 
hydroponics mod (64px and above only).

2012-04-24: reworked all magic lantern images in all packs; on a revisit, I 
decided that the dithering to simulate translucency just doesn't work, so I 
undid the dithering and flattened them all against a dim yellow background.  
Fixed an alpha error that snuck in while making the nether "portal stuff" 
object, reduced 64px and 512px hearts to 32 px each since they'll likely never 
need to be be drawn any larger than that anyway (or probably over 16x16 for 
that matter).  Created a complete 256px version of the pack.

2012-04-22 (even later): Duplicate default_furnace_front.png to a different 
filename for use by the active furnaces mod.

2012-04-22 (a bit later): Replaced active/cooking furnace with a set of images 
to add support for lkjoel's active furnaces mod (WIP).

2012-04-22: Tweaked 16px furnace a bit.  Added images for half heart and 
active/cooking furnace.

2012-04-21: Reworked moreores/gold ore, added support for nether mod.  
Re-uploaded with 16px support for nether (same filename)

2012-04-20 (a bit later): Reworked cooked rat (too many copy&paste artifacts).  
Added support for spotlights mod.

2012-04-20: Reworked default_brick slightly, fixed outdated filenames on 
moreores/mithril ore and cooked rat, reconfigured, renamed, and added a whole 
bunch of textures to bring pack up to date with transition from Moreblocks-OCD 
to Madblocks: this update adds support for all mods in that set, except only 
partial support for infrastructure mod (only the "street builder" object, 64px 
and larger sizes only), and signs mod (64px and up only; 16px is just too low 
of a resolution to retain enough detail).  Tweaked 16px default glass to match 
the various similar glow glass objects.

2012-04-15 (even later): Brightened up and reworked railroad tracks to improve 
quality and tiling.  Reworked all mesecons wires and objects bearing them to 
improve tiling.  Neither category of images was rendered symmetrically, so they 
tiled weird at some rotations.  Updated relevant screenshot.

2012-04-15 (a bit later): reworked default and cherry blossom trees (and tops) 
to use more accurate textures.  Note to self: if it bears apples, it's probably 
an apple tree, and if it has cherry blossoms, it's probably a cherry blossom 
tree. ;-) Also updated the screenshots.

2012-04-15: re-rendered mesecon wires, reworked many mesecons to use the new 
renders, fixed missing alpha channel on terra_redgrass_side and on a couple of 
ores, fixed colors in treeprop to better match default_leaves, fixed a couple 
of oversized images in 64x version (copy&paste error), added partial mesecon 
wires and wire "central nodes" for possible future use, fixed missing wall 
buttons and bouleau trees in 64px version, created complete 16px version.

2012-04-13 (even later): renamed mesecons 'torch' and 'lamp' series and a few 
others, and added a bunch of new imagery to bring support for that mod up to 
date (there were lots of changes upstream that I hadn't accounted for).

2012-04-13 (a bit later): added missing arrow images for throwing mod, added 
missing credits for a few images.

2012-04-13: added imagery for growing trees cherry blossom mod.

2012-04-12 (even later): added imagery for nature pack mods.

2012-04-12 (a bit later): turned straight railroad tracks around the right way, 
updated screenshots.

2012-04-12: added (default) wooden doors.

2012-04-11 (a bit later): added fire, desert stone, desert sand, dry shrub in 
keeping with recent minetest update.

2012-04-11: removed alpha from water, re-rendered stone brick.  Added imagery 
for moreblocks "OCD extension", flowers, terra, growing trees alien, and 
growing trees bouleau mods.

2012-04-09 (even later): added imagery for magic lantern mod, based on the 
author's concept/test images.

2012-04-09 (a bit later): created a 64x64 pixel version.

2012-04-09: thickened vines, re-rendered sand and sandstone, and tweaked ladder 
and a few others to improve tiling and stacking, tweaked tree/jungle tree tops 
to better flow from the sides, darkened/increased saturation on mithril block, 
added beveled edges to bookshelves, furnace front and sides, hatch, many 
mesecons blocks.

2012-04-08: fixed missing alpha channels on default_grass_side and various 
ores.

2012-04-06: initial upload of 512px version for testing.
