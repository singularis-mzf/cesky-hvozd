Ciao!
This is my first mod, so sorry if there are any errors or english typos.

This mod adds to your minetest game various type of sandwiches,
including vegetarian, nutella, bacon, pb&j and many more,
if you have supported mods like BBQ and cucina_vegana!
There are also some other related food like a sweet bread pudding,
made from sandwiches crumbs and jam.

Developed and tested for Minetest 0.4.17 until version 1.7
Developed and tested for Minetest 5.4.x since 1.8
