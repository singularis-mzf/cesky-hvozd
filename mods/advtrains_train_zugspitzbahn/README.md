# AdvTrains Train Pack: Zugspitzbahn

This train pack provides a locomotive and passenger wagon from the Bavarian
Zugspitzbahn, a rack railway system and with a height difference of 1945
metres, the railway with the greatest height difference in Europe.

These wagons run on ordinary rails, since nobody has yet made rack rails for advtrains.
