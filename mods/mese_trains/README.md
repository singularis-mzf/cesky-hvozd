## Description
Currently the modpack includes only one new train, the MeseJet, which is based on the Japanese train from [moretrains](https://content.minetest.net/packages/gpcf/moretrains/) but with different textures, horn sounds and line display support.

### Features
MeseJet: Lines from 1 to 9 will be displayed on the outside as well as on the inside of the train and will differ in color.
