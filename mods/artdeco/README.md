 I want to thank the Minetest creators, devs, and community members who have all put so much work into this free software, and who are always willing and there to help with any questions. All your work is greatly appreciated, and enjoyed.

 The x16 and x32 textures obviously need some tweaking. I will get to them at a later date, I just wanted to make sure they were at least available for users who prefer them.
 The stained glass windows are installed by aiming at either the front or back of the arches blocks. If you point at a regular block and set it, this sets the glass inside said block (a funny glich that turned up).
