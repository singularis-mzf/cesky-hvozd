Note: According to [https://codeberg.org/Nazalassa/advtrains\_moreslopes/src/branch/main/README](https://codeberg.org/Nazalassa/advtrains\_moreslopes/src/branch/main/README) Nazalassa, due to ethical concerns, kindly asks not to upload this work to Github.

My stance follows:

# My stance to ethical concerns with GitHub requests in January 2025

1. I examined known ethical concerns with GitHub (according to Wikipedia) and I found nothing what I consider unethical (in my opinion Facebook and Google do much more unethical things than GitHub).

2. With specific regards of training closed commercial AI models on copylefted code, I belive that it is analogical to studying how the program works and how it is done, which is one of the core free software freedoms that should be protected (you are not obliged to publish source code of your brain due to having memorized some code under GPL and work in some software company). Using that AI to generate closed-source code is another issue, but that is the same what people can do and if you would sue people doing that themselves, you should sue people doing that using AI just the same way, but not to sue or blame people training and licensing that AI.

3. Avoiding services is a wrong and uneffective way of resolving ethical issues. DDT was stopped, because it was forbidden by law, not by kindly asking fields' owners not to use it to grow vegetables for us.

4. I believe that resistance against GitHub may at least partially stem from sources that are unethical themselves, like hate or obscurantism. Because of that suspicion I need more arguments to believe that there is something wrong with GitHub than just vague 'ethical concerns'.

5. This stance may change in the future according to GitHub's actions.

# Decision

According to my stance, I decide not to upload the whole work as long as it would be available elsewhere (I only upload SHA256 hashes that allow to check files for exact match) and not to use any code (it was relatively easy to extend the original Advtrains code to accomodate new models without using any Nazalassa's code), but I need to upload models, because I have not enough skill and time to recreate them from scratch (I could do some microscopic modifications to make them formally modified, but I don't belive that is something that would satisfy Nazalassa's request in any way).
